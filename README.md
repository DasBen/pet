# Pet

Welcome to the Pet project! This project aims to revolutionize the way we handle animal adoptions and care by integrating crowdfunding features to support the lives of animals that do not find a new owner. Each animal will have their own page with a timeline where users can see media posts, leave comments, and like updates. The primary goal of this platform is to raise funds for the care and well-being of the animals and their caretakers.
